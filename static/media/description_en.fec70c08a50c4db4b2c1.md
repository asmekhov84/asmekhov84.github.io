Developed and implemented the following algorithms:

- [solution of the forward and inverse kinematics problems for 6-DOF parallel manipulator](/professional-projects?id=4);
- [analytical solution of the forward and inverse kinematics problems for 6-DOF serial manipulator](/professional-projects?id=9);
- [motion planner for an abstract 6-DOF manipulator](/professional-projects?id=5);
- [planning trajectory for a cleaning laser on a flat surface](/professional-projects?id=8).

Also the following algorithms have been developed and implemented into the [profile sensor software](/professional-projects?id=10), manufactured by the Eidos Robotics: localization of the laser stripe on the image, compensation of the camera lens distortion, intrinsic calibration of the profile sensor, localization of welding joints of four types.

Worked with API of the [Basler industrial camera](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/cameras/area-scan-cameras/ace/aca1280-60gm/).
