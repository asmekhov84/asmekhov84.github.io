Earlier I wrote about [kinematic scheme](/professional-projects?id=4) of the Hexapod robot and the purpose of methods for calculating direct and inverse kinematics. To control this robot precisely, it is also necessary to know exactly coordinates of the joints - points where rods attached to the base and to the moving platform (Ai and Bi on the Stewart platform image below). Due to the assembly imperfection these coordinates are slightly different from the CAD model. The purpose of this work was to create a methodology and develop an application for refining the coordinates of the Hexapod joints.

In accordance with proposed method, a special marker was attached to each rod. Positions of these markers were tracking by a high-accuracy laser interferometer. Each rod then was manually moving around first by the lower end (disconnected from the platform), and next by the upper end (disconnected from the base). During these movements coordinates of the marker were recorded. As a result, a couple of point clouds was obtained for each of six rods. Each of these clouds was then approximated by a sphere. Required coordinates of the joints were at centers of the spheres.

I have developed an application that allows to calculate coordinates of the joints of the platform and base using the collected point clouds. The application was written in the C#. The AlgLib library was used to approximate point clouds with spheres. For 3D rendering the OpenTK library was using.
