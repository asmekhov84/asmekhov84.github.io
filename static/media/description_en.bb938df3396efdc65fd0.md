This page contains descriptions of some of the work tasks I have done. They follow in reverse chronological order. For each of them, I tried to briefly state the essence, and also gave a list of technologies used in the development process.

This is not a complete list of tasks I've solved. These are only the most interesting tasks I can tell about and which were solved by me in whole or at least in the most part. Also, a mandatory condition for adding to the list was the able to show the result in the form of images or animations.

The tag cloud below shows all the technologies used among all of the tasks. Size of each tag depends on number of its occurrences.
