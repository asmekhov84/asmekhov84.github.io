Here I was developing and implementing different computer vision algorithms, including:

- [method to perform automatic extrinsic calibration of the profile sensor](/professional-projects?id=12);
- algorithms to detect welding seams of various types based on data from the profile sensor;
- [different methods of point clouds registration](/professional-projects?id=15).

Implemented the algorithms into the project based on the ROS framework. Worked with API of the [Wenglor industrial profile sensor](https://www.wenglor.com/en/2D3D-Sensors/2D3D-Profile-Sensors/2D3D-Profile-Sensor/p/MLSL123/).

**Technologies**: C++, Python, MATLAB, STL, Eigen, PCL, NumPy, Google Test, ROS, CMake, Bazel, CLion, Git, Ubuntu, YouTrack, ClickUp, GitLab
