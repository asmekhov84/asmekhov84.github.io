In developing new cars it's necessary to do many tests. It caused by the need to make the cars more safe, to optimize fuel consumptions, etc. But full-scale tests are very expensive, labor-intensive and dangerous in some cases. Solution of this problem is a computer simulation. Computer models can give a lot of information about dynamic properties of a car without a spending for real tests. The purpose of this work was to create a dynamic model of flat movement of four-wheel vehicle.

It this work I have implemented a mathematical model, given by a system of algebraic and differential equations, using the MathWorks Simulink software. I've also developed a simple user interface, allowing to control the steering, throttle, transmission ratio and change a type of road surface, which is defining friction coefficient between the road and wheels. The Simulink in realtime can plot graphs of speed, fuel consumption, slippage coefficients and normal reactions on each of 4 wheels.

The pictures below show some of blocks of the implemented model. There is also a video created for the Simulink Student Challenge. The project has taken [3-rd place](https://blogs.mathworks.com/simulink/2013/01/07/congratulations-to-the-winners-of-the-2012-simulink-student-challenge/) out of 20+ in this contest.
