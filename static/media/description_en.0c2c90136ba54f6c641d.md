Laser cleaning technology is using to remove rust and paint from metal surfaces, prepare the surface for painting, etc. Laser cleaning equipment installed on a robotic manipulator allows to automate this process. It's well explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sTtcWcA8iI).

The goal of this project was to develop an algorithm able to generate the manipulator's trajectory based on scans of the cleaning surface, obtained from a 3D sensor. This algorithm must also take into account a limitation on the maximum possible width of the laser stripe.

In this project I was developed a method generating trajectory of the manipulator to clean a flat surface, which is using an existing 3D model of a part.
