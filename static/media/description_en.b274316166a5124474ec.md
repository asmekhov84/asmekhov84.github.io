In a team of 2 people I worked on a computer vision system for an automated laser cutting complex. I was responsible mainly for algorithms for processing point clouds and polygonal meshes: filtering, normals estimation, clustering, point clouds registration, surface reconstruction from a point cloud, etc. I also developed small applications to calibrate a profile sensor mounted on a 6-axis manipulator, and to calibrate a static 3D sensor with respect to base of the manipulator.

Another notable project was an application for assisted labeling of medical video records, captured from an endoscopic device. This device was equipped with a video camera and a laser emitting optical fiber, used to break kidney stones. The task was to create a video labeling tool to teach algorithms to understand whether the laser fiber is directed to the stone or not and thus to prevent human tissue damage. In this work, I was developing a client-side application, which was implemented on C++ and Qt framework. This application allows to load video file and choose a classification label for each frame manually or automatically, using pretrained ML-model, and then export this dataset for further needs.
