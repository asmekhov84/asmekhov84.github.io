In a team of 2 people I worked on a computer vision system for an automated laser cutting complex. I was responsible mainly for algorithms for processing point clouds and polygonal meshes: filtering, normals estimation, clustering, point clouds registration, surface reconstruction from a point cloud, etc. I also developed applications for calibrating the profile sensor mounted on the manipulator, and for calibrating a static 3D sensor relative to base of the manipulator.
