When writing reports on gas engines testing, it becomes necessary to display graphs of several quantities with different units on one page at once. These quantities ​​can have different value ranges ​​(e.g. 10 for one and 1000 for another), which makes it difficult to visually represent them on a single axis plot. The purpose of this work was to create an application that allows to display and print a multi-axis plots.

Below are images of the application I developed that implements the required functionality. The application has flexible settings for the appearance, arrangement and grouping of graphs.
