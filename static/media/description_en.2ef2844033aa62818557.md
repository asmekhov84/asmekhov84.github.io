Hi! I'm **Artemiy Smekhov**. I've been developing commercial software for industrial automation for more than 7 years. My professional interests are computational geometry, graph theory, numerical optimization, computer vision, machine learning, robotics and visualization. For most problems I usually use the C++ language. Sometimes I use Python and MATLAB for algorithms prototyping and debugging.

I have an educational background in applied mathematics and computer science.
