Hi! I'm **Artemii Smekhov**. I've been developing commercial software for industrial automation for more than 8 years. My professional interests are computational geometry, graph theory, numerical optimization, computer vision, machine learning, robotics and visualization. For most problems I usually use Python and C++ languages. Sometimes I use MATLAB for algorithms prototyping and debugging.

I have an educational background in applied mathematics and computer science. In my spare time I try to learn new technologies and deepen my existing knowledge.
