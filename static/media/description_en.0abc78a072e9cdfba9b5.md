At this role I was developing and implementing many different algorithms and approaches, including:

- refinement of kinematic model (DH parameters) of 6-axis robot using optical tracker;
- calibration of camera intrinsic/extrinsic parameters with charuco board;
- positioning of objects by a single camera and aruco markers;
- estimation of level of semitransparent beverages in a cup;
- detection of smartphone camera defects by a photo;
- developing RoboDK driver for Dobot robots;
- simulation of a robot given by DH model.

Also I gained some experience with HIKROBOT cameras, Dobot robots, Creaform C-Track optical positioning system.
